# Angular project 14

In this project, I use ng-repeat and create a custom directive.
It is just a mockup of a potential web app using ng-repeat.

To run, you must have Node installed.
You also should have http-server installed.  You can do so by typing `npm install http-server -g`.

to run, move to the lab14 directory and type `http-server -c-1`.
Then type this in your browser url: `localhost:8080`
